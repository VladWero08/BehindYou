### 📝 Description

Meet "Behind You" – your line-following companion!

Powered by Pololu QTR reflectance sensors and the trusty Arduino UNO, this little robot was designed to follow a *black line* on a *white sheet of paper* as fast as it could. The line follower uses a **PID** control system to center itself on the black line. Besides optimizing its following capacities, the support on which it stands and the overall design was hand-made using a big piece of *foamy paper*, *zips*, *scissors*, and *passion*.

In the competition in which it participated, it completed the rally in **30.246 seconds**.

### 🎨 Design

Our main focus on the design was to minimize the space the line follower needs, because the smaller it is, the easier is to take turns and follow a rally with multiple curves. In that sense, we used a small breadboard. 
The geometric shape represented by the *gray lines* is the base of our line follower, constructed from the *foamy paper* mentioned previously. 

The purpose of the *white ball* was for the line follower to take turns.

*NOTE: the white ball will be underneath the base, and all other components will be on top of it.*
